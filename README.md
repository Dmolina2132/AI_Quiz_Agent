# ü§ñ AI Quiz with LangGraph  

An interactive **quiz game powered by LangGraph and LLMs**, where the logic of the game is modeled as a graph of states.  
The quiz dynamically generates questions, evaluates answers, provides feedback, and tracks player scores.  

This project demonstrates how to use **LangGraph** to build structured workflows on top of Large Language Models (LLMs).
